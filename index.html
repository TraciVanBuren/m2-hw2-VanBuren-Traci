    <h1>Hi! I'm Traci.</h1>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p> My hobbies include </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skiing (Fall is my favorite time of year because it means that I only have to wait a couple more months until winter.)</li> 
                        <li>Reading</li>
                        <li>Aerial Arts - Aerial arts is a relatively new sport and is an odd mixture of flexibility, yoga, dance and tumbling, all on different apparatus. Some of the events under aerial arts include silks, lyra and acrobatics. I take classes at <a href="https://monarcainflight.com/">Monarca in Flight Aerial Arts Studio</a>. Below is an example of some dancers doing aerial arts:</li>

        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
                <p> Currently, I'm a print production specialist at a marketing firm in Virginia. I have an M.A. from the University of Baltimore in publication design and I'm working on another graduate degree in political communication from the University of Florida. Politics and news/current events have always fascinated me and I love that I can combine it with my strong foundation in design and communication.</p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>Like most people, my interests are diverse. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>I'm a <strong>Vegetarian</strong></li>First and foremost, I'm a vegetarian. Eighteen years ago I gave up meat and seafood, (anything with a face) for ethical reasons and I've never looked back. Besides allowing me to sleep easier at night and look myself in the mirror in the morning, being a vegetarian is great for my health. My doctor is a huge fan of my plant-based diet and flat-out told me she wished her other patients were plant-based as well.<br><br>
                        <li>and an <strong>Animal Lover</strong></li>Loving and caring for animals goes hand-in-hand with being a vegetarian. I have two cats:      
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Aubrey</em> is an American domestic (mixed breed).</li>
                                <img src="Aubrey.jpg" alt="Aubrey" width="200"> 
                                    
                                <li><em>Jasper</em> is a dwarf Maine Coon.</li>
                                <img src="Jasper.jpg" alt="Jasper" width="200"></ul> 
                            While Aubrey and Jasper are both marmalade tabbies, their personalities couldn't be more different. Jasper is an extrovert and Aubrey is an introvert.</ul><br><br>
                           
                        <li>When I'm not in school, I'm very <strong>Politically Active.</strong>  (Hence, the graduate degree in political communications). I'm looking forward to the next election because I havn't been canvassing for a while and I miss discussing politics with voters. </li>
                    </ol></p>
